		<p>In February 1979, Paula Wolfert penned an article about great 
		Alsatian chefs cooking their mothers' food. Included was André Soltner, 
		then the chef at the legendary Lutèce in Manhattan. Soltner opted to recreate 
		his mother's outstanding potato pie, which Wolfert said was "a simple 
		thing, yet elegant." It consisted of a flaky pâte brisée filled with 
		thinly sliced potatoes, bacon, hard-cooked eggs, herbs, and crème fraîche. 
		Wolfert noted how strongly Soltner felt while preparing the tart, with 
		"pleasure and nostalgia plainly visible on his face." The secret to the
		flaky pâte brisée is the single turn made with the dough in step 2. This 
		is home cooking at its best, from one of America's most revered French chefs. 
		Soltner described the food of his native Alsace as based on "very good 
		dry white wines and wonderful regional produce." This pie makes a simple, 
		elegant, and satisfying weekend lunch paired with a chilled bottle of Alsace 
		wine and a green salad. In a pinch, use a store-bought pie crust.</p>

		<h2 class="footAlign">Step 1</h2>
		<p>Stir together flour, butter, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. 
		Using your fingertips, rub butter into flour mixture until mixture 
		resembles coarse meal. Make a well in center. Stir together 1 egg yolk 
		with enough ice water to equal 1/4 cup; pour into well, and stir into 
		flour mixture until just moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured 
		surface. Knead dough just until it comes together. Divide dough into 2 disks. 
		Wrap each disk in plastic wrap, and chill at least 8 hours or overnight.</p>
		
		<h2 class="footAlign">Step 2</h2>
		<p>Preheat oven to 400°F. Unwrap 1 dough disk, and roll into a 13-inch round 
		on a lightly floured surface; fit into a 9-inch pie pan. Chill 10 minutes.</p>
		
		<h2 class="footAlign">Step 3</h2>
		<p>Meanwhile, soak potato slices in ice water to cover (to remove surface starch) 
		about 5 minutes; drain and pat slices dry. Toss potatoes with parsley, 
		pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Place bacon in a large skillet, and 
		cook over medium-high, stirring occasionally, until wilted and just browned 
		on edges, about 2 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels.</p>
		
		<h2 class="footAlign">Step 4</h2>
		<p>Arrange half of potato slices in refrigerated pie shell, overlapping slices. 
		Sprinkle evenly with bacon; top with remaining potato slices, overlapping slices. 
		Spread crème fraîche over potatoes, and arrange egg slices on top. Unwrap remaining 
		dough disk, and roll into a 10-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Place 
		round on top of pie. Trim edges and fold dough under. Crimp edge as desired. Using 
		the tip of a knife, prick top of pie twice.</p>
		
		<h2 class="footAlign">Step 5</h2>
		<p>Stir together 1 teaspoon water and remaining egg yolk; brush over top of pie. 
		Bake pie in preheated oven on middle rack 20 minutes; reduce oven temperature to 
		350°F, and bake 50 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F, and bake until top 
		is golden brown, about 10 minutes.</p>
		
		<h2 class="footAlign">Step 6</h2>
		<p>Let pie rest 10 minutes before serving.</p>
